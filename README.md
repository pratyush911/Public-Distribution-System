# PDS
The Public Distribution System (PDS) is an important part of food security policy of a welfare state like India. A supposedly seeming simple task of distributing food grains to the poor and needy has many challenges. Hastily deployed technocratic designs among the underprivileged with poorly analysed and incomplete use cases and without adequate understanding of the social and cultural context can cause distress. This paper aims to analyse the requirements for an effective PDS system, and then goes on to describe a Functional design for the same. I will highlight and focus on the functional requirements and design changes for the transaction process at the Fair Price Shops (FPS), especially focusing on a design that removes bindings of users with particular FPSs.
